# M01W02 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

### Primitive
* data type that is stored directly in memory
* cannot be changed once created (immutable)

### Objects
* not stored directly in memory
* can be changed once created (mutable)


```js
const str = 'hello';
const bool = false;
const num = 4.14;
const nul = null;
const undef = undefined;

const bigInt = 42n;
const sym = Symbol('hello');
```
